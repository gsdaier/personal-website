# Welcome to My Personal Website
### A website with some cool functions and informations

<h4> - It has a button that serves to change the theme of the landing page, to blue or black with red </h4>
<a>This is for a better comfort to the eyes of those who are accessing the site, because of the blue light, depending mainly on the time of day, it can cause some discomfort or problem in the eyes</a>

<h4> - It has a button that goes directly to my linkedin, another to my github and another to contact me by email </h4>
<a>This makes it easy for anyone who needs to know more about me or talk to me directly</a>
